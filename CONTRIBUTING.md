## Code of Conduct

People are expected to follow the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html)
when discussing Schrodinger on the GitHub page, Gitter channel, or other venues.

We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If you find 
yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or that fails to live up 
to our expectations, you should disengage and contact one of the project maintainers 
in private. We hope to avoid letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings 
escalate into larger problems.

## General Workflow

1. Make sure you can license your work under Apache 2.0 

2. Before starting to work, make sure there is a ticket in the issue
   or create one first. It can help accelerate the acceptance process
   if the change is agreed upon

3. If you don't have write access to the repository, you should do
   your work in a local branch of your own fork and then submit a pull
   request. If you do have write access to the repository, never work
   directly on master.

4. When the work is completed, submit a Pull Request.

5. Anyone can comment on a pull request and you are expected to
   answer questions or to incorporate feedback.

6. It is not allowed to force push to the branch on which the pull
   request is based.
