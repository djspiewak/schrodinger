# Contributing to the Typelevel Effects Project

The Typelevel Effects project welcomes contributions from anybody who wants to participate in moving this initiative forward. All code or documentation that is contributed will have to be covered by a waiver of all copyrights and other rights as detailed by the COPYING file at the repository's root, the rationale for this is that the APIs defined by this project shall be freely implementable and usable by everyone.

## Copyright Statement

The aforementioned waiver of copyrights and other rights is represented by the addition of a line to the file [CopyrightWaivers.txt](https://github.com/typelevel/effects/blob/master/CopyrightWaivers.txt). For a pull request to be considered every contributor must have signed the copyright statement in this way; this may be included within that same pull request.

## Code of Conduct

People are expected to follow the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html)
when discussing this project on the Github page, Gitter channel, or other venues.

We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If you find
yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or that fails to live up
to our expectations, you should disengage and contact one of the project maintainers
in private. We hope to avoid letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings
escalate into larger problems.

## General Workflow

1. Make sure you have signed the Copyright Statement, see above.

2. Before starting to work, make sure there is a ticket in the issue
   or create one first. It can help accelerate the acceptance process
   if the change is agreed upon

3. If you don't have write access to the repository, you should do
   your work in a local branch of your own fork and then submit a pull
   request. If you do have write access to the repository, never work
   directly on master.

4. When the work is completed, submit a Pull Request.

5. Anyone can comment on a pull request and you are expected to
   answer questions or to incorporate feedback.

6. It is not allowed to force push to the branch on which the pull
   request is based.

## Pull Request Requirements

For a Pull Request to be considered at all it has to meet these requirements:

1. If applicable, the new or fixed features must be accompanied by comprehensive tests.
2. If applicable, the pull request must contain all necessary documentation updates required by the changes introduced.
3. The pull request must not contain changes that are unrelated to the ticket that it corresponds to. One pull request is meant to introduce only one logically contiguous change.
